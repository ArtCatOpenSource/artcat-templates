h1. ArtCat Hosting Templates

These are free and open-source templates used for "ArtCat Hosting":http://hosting.artcat.com/ artist and art gallery websites.

They use the "Liquid":http://liquidmarkup.org/ templating language.

Any non-template assets needed, such as CSS or Javascript files, should be put in the assets directory, and a file with a list of the asset file names called *files.txt* (one file per line) should be put in that same directory. CSS files will be loaded into the template, in the order specified in files.txt, using the tag @{% client_css %}@. Similarly, Javascript files will be put into the template where the tag @{% client_css %}@ appears.
